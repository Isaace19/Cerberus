# Example-Code Description:
Programming Projects
Here's the sample code from my COSC 102 Course at UTK, later pushes to the master branch will include First Robotics (FRC) code
The 102 Code was created last semester in May, and the Robotics code is a bit older, maybe around 2018 - 2019, but was compiled in Java 11. 
I'm going to just push the example codes to the master branch, this should be a private repo as well. 

# PPM_Lab
This was a file manipulation lab where we took image inputs with a .ppm file from the user and then a command to modify the image. 
Basic commands to the image such as invert the colors, flip x and y axis. Code was compiled to c++11

# MUD Lab
Multi User Dungeon Lab - classic terminal game made with pointers and a provided input file that contained text about each room that the user navigated. 
I will add the robotics code once I have the time later, most likely sometime next month when I get back home. 
C++11 Code
