# Maintenence 

Personal Projects: KD-Tree implementations, 3D space closest point calculations. Vision planning with bad/incomplete data. 

Fixes: Started with my own implementation of KDTree, nothing to fancy, should just start with a basic splitting
but I stil have to learn how to implement and understand how more complex trees work. 

Future -- Solve the Rosetta Code problem for KDtree. 

Future DSA to research:
R trees and Veroni Graph
# As of 11/07/2025

A mass refiling and pause on work. Any DSA work is now in DSA dir
Any projects done outside of C/C++ should go into languages, mainly since I don't code in other languages as of yet
Eliza Project - stonewalled for now but will definitely be something that I come back to when bored.
