# Maintenence 

Personal Projects: KD-Tree implementations, 3D space closest point calculations. Vision planning with bad/incomplete data. 

Fixes: Started with my own implementation of KDTree, nothing to fancy, should just start with a basic splitting
but I stil have to learn how to implement and understand how more complex trees work. 

Future -- Solve the Rosetta Code problem for KDtree. 

Future DSA to research:
R trees and Veroni Graph
